Compare two fractions

Given two fractions a/b and c/d, compare them and print the larger of the two.

Example 1:

Input:
s = "5/6, 11/45"
Output: 5/6
Explanation:
5/6=0.8333... and 11/45=0.2444.... 
Clearly, 5/6 is greater, so we output it.
 

Example 2:

Input:
s = "8/1, 8/1"
Output: equal

Explanation:
We can see that both the fractions are same, 
so they are equal.


Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function compareFrac() 
which takes the string s as input parameters and returns the fraction that is greater. 
If they are equal, then return "equal".

Expected Time Complexity: O(len|s|)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

 

Constraints:
0<=a,c<=1000
1<=b,d<=1000
