Java List
For this problem, we have  types of queries you can perform on a List:
Insert  at index :
Insert
x y
Delete the element at index :
Delete
x
Given a list, , of  integers, perform  queries on the list. Once all queries are completed, 
print the modified list as a single line of space-separated integers.
Input Format
The first line contains an integer,  (the initial number of elements in ). 
The second line contains  space-separated integers describing . 
The third line contains an integer,  (the number of queries). 
The  subsequent lines describe the queries, and each query is described over two lines:
If the first line of a query contains the String Insert, then the second line contains 
two space separated integers , and the value  must be inserâ€¦

Problem Statement
Welcome to Day 8! Check out a video review of dictionaries and hashmaps here
	(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbDhDMYxUEw&feature=youtu.be), or just jump
	right into the problem.
You are given a phone book that consists of your friend's names and their phone number.
	After that you will be given your friend's name as query. For each query, print the
	phone number of your friend.
Input Format
The first line will have an integer N denoting the number of entries in the phone book
	Each entry consists of two lines: a name and the corresponding phone number. 
After these, there will be some queries. Each query will contain name of a friend. Read
	the queries until end-of-file.
Constraints
A name consists of only lower-case English letters and it may be in the format 
'first-name last-name' or in the format 'first-name'. Each phone number has exactly
	8 digits without any leading zeros.
1<=N<=104
1<=queries<=104
Output Format
For each case, print "Not found" without quotes, if the friend has no entry in the
	phone book. Otherwise, print the friend's name and phone number. See sample output
	for the exact format.
To make the problem easier, we provided a portion of the code in the editor. You can
	either complete that code or write completely on your own.
