Let's play a game on an array! You're standing at index 0 of an n-element array named game. From some index i,
you can perform one of the following moves:

Move One Backward: If cell i-1 exists and contains a zero, you can walk back to cell .
Move Forward:

If cell i+1 contains a zero, you can walk to cell i+1.
If cell i+leap contains a zero, you can jump to cell i+leap.

If you're standing on a cell which and in your next move you can either walk one forward or one leap forward and 
jump out of array you win!

Outputs YES if there is a path otherwise outputs NO
