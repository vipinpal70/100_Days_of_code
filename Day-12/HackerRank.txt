Given a string, S , matching the regular expression [A-Za-z !,?._'@]+, split the string into tokens. We define a token to be one or more consecutive English alphabetic letters. Then, print the number of tokens, followed by each token on a new line.

Note: You may find the String.split method helpful in completing this challenge.

Input Format

A single string, S .

Constraints
 1 < Length os S < 4.10^5
 S is composed of any of the following: English alphabetic letters, blank spaces, exclamation points (!), commas (,), 
 question marks (?), periods (.), underscores (_), apostrophes ('), and at symbols (@).
 
Output Format

On the first line, print an integer, N, denoting the number of tokens in string S (they do not need to be unique).
Next, print each of the N tokens on a new line in the same order as they appear in input string S.

Sample Input

He is a very very good boy, isn't he?

Sample Output

10
He
is
a
very
very
good
boy
isn
t
he

Explanation

We consider a token to be a contiguous segment of alphabetic characters. 
There are a total of 10 such tokens in string S , and each token is printed in the same order in which it appears in string S.
