Problem

Chef has made a list for his monthly expenses. The list has N expenses with index 1 to N.
The money spent on each expense depends upon the monthly income of Chef.

Chef spends 50\% of his total income on the expense with index 1.
The money spent on the i^{th} expense (i>1) is equal to 50% of the amount remaining, after paying for all expenses with indices less than i.
Given that Chef earns 2^X rupees in a month, find the amount he saves after paying for all N expenses.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two space-separated integers N and X — where N denotes the number of expenses and 2^X denotes the monthly income of Chef.

Explanation:

Test case 1: The number of expenses are 1 and Chef's monthly income is 2^2 = 42.
 
Chef spends 50%of his monthly income, that is, 2 on first expense and saves the remaining amount 4−2=2.

Test case 22: The number of expenses are 11 and Chef's monthly income is 2^3 = 82 
3
 =8.
Chef spends 50\%50% of his monthly income, that is, 44 on first expense and saves the remaining amount 8-4 = 48−4=4.

Test case 33: The number of expenses are 22 and Chef's monthly income is 2^3 = 82 
3
 =8.

Chef spends 50\%50% of his monthly income, that is, 44 on first expense. The remaining amount is 8-4=48−4=4.
Chef spends 50\%50% of the remaining amount, that is, 22 on his second expense. The remaining amount is 4-2=24−2=2 which goes into his savings.
Test case 44: The number of expenses are 33 and Chef's monthly income is 2^4 = 162 
4
 =16.

Chef spends 50\%50% of his monthly income, that is, 88 on first expense. The remaining amount is 16-8=816−8=8.
Chef spends 50\%50% of the remaining amount, that is, 44 on second expense. The remaining amount is 8-4=48−4=4.
Chef spends 50\%50% of the remaining amount, that is, 22 on his third expense. The remaining amount is 4-2=24−2=2 which goes into his savings.
