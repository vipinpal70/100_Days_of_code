Given a binary number, Find, if given binary number is a multiple of 3. 
The given number can be big upto 2^10000. It is recommended to finish the task using one traversal of input binary string.

Example 1:

Input: S = "011"
Output: 1
Explanation: "011" decimal equivalent
is 3, which is divisible by 3.
â€‹Example 2:

Input: S = "100"
Output: 0
Explanation: "100" decimal equivalent
is 4, which is not divisible by 3.
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function
isDivisible() which takes the string s as inputs and returns 1 if the given number is divisible by 3 otherwise 0.

Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ |S| ≤ 10^5
